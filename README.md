# Accessing, subsetting and downloading the National Water Model v3.0 (NWMv3.0) retrospective simulation data for Arizona

This project includes several sample Python scrips and modules designed to help users easily access and download the NWMv3.0 retrospective dataset hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The dataset is available in Zarr format, and the provided scripts facilitate straightforward interaction with the data.

For more details about the dataset, including a link to the AWS bucket, visit the [NWM Archive](https://registry.opendata.aws/nwm-archive/).

In this example, the scripts are designed to extract NWMv3.0 inputs (static parameters and forcings) and outputs for all the Hydrologic Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) basins for the state of Arizona.
